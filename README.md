Nominate is a website for sending in your top 5 movies.

Add movies to your nomination list by selecting a result from the search. Your submission will appear on the 'Nominees' page. Browse through the lists to see what other people nominated as their top 5's.

All movie data is retrieved with the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/).
